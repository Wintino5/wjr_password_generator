Password Generator Site WJR

# Horiseon Website

## Description

In this challenge we used JavaScript to create a password generator. We gave the user the option to select the amount of characters to be used in the password as well as the choice to use lowercase, and uppercase letters, numbers and special characters. This challenge was very helpful in understanding JavaScript and the basics of how it can be used to interact with an interface.
